## ALAU - AddressList Auto Update
Script can update your addresslist from remote location (http/https).
It can be list for ban, some favorite IPs or whitelist...

Added v01 version:
* dynamic addresses may not supported correctly and may bring error;
* rsc file format very important;
* list in rsc file, it's pretty solid now, but you need check "format" ;-(
